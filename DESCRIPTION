Description: A estimation method that improve the applicability of Maximum Product of Spacings(MPS) in left-tructed data. Details of this method were described in Giuricich & Burnecki(2019), Modelling of left-truncated heavy-tailed data with application to catastrophe bond pricing[J]. Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, 2019, 525: 498-513.
